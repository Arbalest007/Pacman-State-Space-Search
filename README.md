# Installation
This requires python 3.6, I already have 3.11 installed and don't want to affect other projects.
I have conda installed, so using [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43630002/conda-install-downgrade-python-version) as a guide I created a new conda env with:

`conda create --name pacman python=3.6 anaconda`

Then:

`conda activate pacman`

When done:

`conda deactivate`
